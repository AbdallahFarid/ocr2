# 1. Goals & Background Context
The goal of this project is to build an automated cheque processing platform that digitizes, extracts, validates, and integrates cheque data into enterprise financial systems. Current manual cheque processing is error-prone, time-consuming, and costly. This system aims to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, increase straight-through-processing (STP) rates, and provide a robust human-in-the-loop fallback for exceptional cases.

Key drivers:
- Reduce cheque processing time from days to minutes.
- Improve accuracy to >99.5% on key fields.
- Minimize operational costs by automating repetitive tasks.
- Ensure compliance with banking and business rules.
