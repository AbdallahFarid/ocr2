# 4.1 — CSV/XLSX Export with Schema Validation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to export validated cheque data to CSV/XLSX with schema checks,
**so that** downstream processes can consume it reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CSV and XLSX export formats implemented with headers and types.
2. Only validated, approved cheques included.
3. Schema validation runs before writing files.

## Dev Notes (Architecture References)
- Export [Source: architecture/components.md#9-export-integration]
- PRD export requirements [Source: prd/2-requirements.md#functional-requirements]
- Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing
- Test file location: `backend/tests/services/test_exporter.py`
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; target ≥ 85% coverage on core logic
- Frameworks: `pytest`
- Story-specific: schema validation prior to write; only approved cheques included per `testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Implement export module `backend/app/services/exporter.py`.
- Schema definitions and validators.
- Tests for CSV/XLSX correctness.

## Project Structure Notes
- Keep file I/O isolated; core logic testable without filesystem.
