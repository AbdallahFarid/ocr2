# 1.5 — Parsing & Normalization

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** deterministic parsers (regex + finite-state grammars) to normalize dates, amounts, cheque numbers, IBAN, and names,
**so that** I can cross-check amount-in-words vs numeric and provide reliable structured outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Deterministic parsing functions exist for dates, amounts, cheque numbers, IBAN, names.
2. Amount-in-words cross-matched to numeric; mismatch flagged.
3. Parsers return structured values and error codes on failure.

## Dev Notes (Architecture References)
- Parsing details [Source: architecture/components.md#5-parsing-normalization]
- Tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Testing
- Test file location: `backend/tests/parsers/test_parsers.py`
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; target ≥ 85% coverage on core logic
- Frameworks: `pytest`; include property-based tests
- Story-specific: verify amount-in-words vs numeric cross-check; error code mapping per `testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Implement parsers under `backend/app/parsers/`.
- Implement normalization and error code mapping.
- Tests: `backend/tests/parsers/test_parsers.py` with property-based cases for edge inputs.

## Project Structure Notes
- Keep parsing deterministic and easily testable; no hidden side-effects.
