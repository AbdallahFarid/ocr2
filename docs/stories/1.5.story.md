# 1.5 — Parsing & Normalization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** deterministic parsers (regex + finite-state grammars) to normalize dates, amounts, cheque numbers, IBAN, and names,
**so that** I can cross-check amount-in-words vs numeric and provide reliable structured outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Deterministic parsing functions exist for dates, amounts, cheque numbers, names.
2. Parsers return structured values and error codes on failure.
3. Amount-in-words cross-match is deferred for MVP; to be implemented in a later iteration if needed.

## Dev Notes (Architecture References)
- Parsing details [Source: architecture/components.md#5-parsing-normalization]
- Tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Testing
- Test file locations: `backend/tests/parsers/test_parsers.py`, `backend/tests/pipeline/test_postprocess.py`
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; target ≥ 85% coverage on core logic
- Frameworks: `pytest`; include property-based tests
- Story-specific: verify amount-in-words vs numeric cross-check; error code mapping per `testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement basic parsers under `backend/app/parsers/` for date, amount, cheque number, and name normalization.
- [ ] Implement amount-in-words (Arabic/English) parser and cross-check vs numeric. (Deprioritized for MVP due to Arabic OCR variability)
- [x] Implement normalization and error code mapping for all parsers.
- [x] Unit tests: `backend/tests/parsers/test_parsers.py` for basic cases (date century fix, amount parsing, cheque no., Arabic name normalization).
- [ ] Property-based tests for edge inputs.

## Project Structure Notes
- Keep parsing deterministic and easily testable; no hidden side-effects.
