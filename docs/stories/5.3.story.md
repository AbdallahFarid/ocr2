# 5.3 â€” Alerting and Log Aggregation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As an** operator,
**I want** alerting and centralized logs,
**so that** I can react to anomalies and failures quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Alerts set up for STP dips, error spikes, and integration failures.
2. Centralized logs with correlation IDs; searchable.
3. Runbooks documented for common alerts.

## Dev Notes (Architecture References)
- Monitoring [Source: architecture/components.md#10-monitoring]
- Coding standards logging [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing
- Test locations: alert rule config tests where possible; backend tests for log fields/correlation IDs
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- Frameworks: backend tests with `pytest`; manual/automated validation for alerting tool
- Story-specific: verify alert thresholds and runbooks coverage per `testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Configure alerting rules.
- Set up log aggregation (e.g., ELK/CloudWatch/Stack).
- Write runbooks in `docs/ops/runbooks/`.

## Project Structure Notes
- Keep alerting thresholds configurable and versioned.
