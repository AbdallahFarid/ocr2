# 3.3 â€” Correction Workflow + Template/Dataset Update

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to persist reviewer corrections and update templates/datasets,
**so that** future extractions improve over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Corrections persisted with audit details (who, when, before/after).
2. Template library and training datasets receive updates consistent with governance.
3. Backend API supports corrections with validation.

## Dev Notes (Architecture References)
- Human-in-the-Loop UI [Source: architecture/components.md#8-human-in-the-loop-ui]
- Data model audit trail [Source: architecture/data-model-core-tables.md#cheque]
- Coding standards & logging [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing
- Test locations: backend API tests and frontend integration tests
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; enforce ESLint/Prettier on UI
- Frameworks: `pytest` for backend; React Testing Library for UI
- Story-specific: verify audit details and queued updates to templates/datasets per `testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Backend endpoint `POST /cheques/{id}/corrections` with validation. (implemented as `POST /review/items/{bank}/{file_id}/corrections`)
- [x] Persist corrections to `cheque.audit_json` and field records. (via audit JSON `append_corrections`)
- [x] Hook for template update queue; document governance for dataset updates. (writes CSV queue at `backend/reports/pipeline/corrections/corrections.csv`, override via `CORRECTIONS_OUT`)
- [x] Frontend forms to submit corrections. (inline edit input + Save wired; success/failure banner)
- [x] Tests for backend and UI flows. (backend API tests added; UI unit/integration tests covered in 3.1/3.2)

## Project Structure Notes
- Updates to templates/datasets should be queued and reviewed before applying.

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented FastAPI app `backend/app/main.py` and router `backend/app/api/review.py`.
- Corrections handler appends detailed records and updates `parse_norm` fields.
- Dynamic `AUDIT_ROOT` resolution enables isolated tests with temp directories.
- Pydantic v2 models and `model_dump()` used for payload transformations.
- Backend test covers list/get/corrections roundtrip.

### File List
- backend/app/main.py (new)
- backend/app/api/__init__.py (new)
- backend/app/api/review.py (new)
- backend/app/persistence/audit.py (updated: `append_corrections`)
- backend/app/schemas/review.py (new)
- backend/tests/api/test_review_endpoints.py (new)
- backend/pyproject.toml (updated: FastAPI deps, package discovery, dev deps)
