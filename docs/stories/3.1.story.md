# 3.1 â€” Reviewer Console Shell (Layout and Data Wiring)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** reviewer,
**I want** a console with the cheque image and extracted fields side-by-side,
**so that** I can review and correct quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Two-pane layout with responsive design.
2. Fields panel displays extracted values, confidences, and validation status.
3. Data wiring to backend API to fetch cheque details and submit corrections (stubbed OK).

## Dev Notes (Architecture References)
- Human-in-the-Loop UI [Source: architecture/components.md#8-human-in-the-loop-ui]
- Tech stack (React + shadcn/ui) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Testing
- Test file location: frontend tests alongside components/pages
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; enforce ESLint/Prettier
- Frameworks: e.g., Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library
- Story-specific: render layout, verify data wiring stubs, and responsiveness per `testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement base layout in `frontend/src/pages/review/[chequeId].tsx`.
- [x] Componentize fields list `frontend/src/components/ReviewFields.tsx`.
- [x] API stubs under `frontend/src/utils/api.ts`.
- [x] Basic tests for rendering and data wiring.

## Project Structure Notes
- Keep UI state local; add global state only if required by navigation.
