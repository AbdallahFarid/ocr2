# 3.1 â€” Reviewer Console Shell (Layout and Data Wiring)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** reviewer,
**I want** a console with the cheque image and extracted fields side-by-side,
**so that** I can review and correct quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Two-pane layout with responsive design.
2. Fields panel displays extracted values, confidences, and validation status.
3. Data wiring to backend API to fetch cheque details and submit corrections (stubbed OK).

### Testing
- Test file location: frontend tests alongside components/pages
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; enforce ESLint/Prettier
- Frameworks: e.g., Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library
- Story-specific: render layout, verify data wiring stubs, and responsiveness per `testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Implement base layout in `frontend/src/pages/review/[chequeId].tsx`.
- Componentize fields list `frontend/src/components/ReviewFields.tsx`.

- Basic tests for rendering and data wiring.

## Project Structure Notes
