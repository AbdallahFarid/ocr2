# 3.2 â€” Keyboard Shortcuts and Low-confidence Highlighting

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** reviewer,
**I want** keyboard-first controls and visual cues for low-confidence fields,
**so that** I can correct faster with fewer clicks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Keyboard navigation across fields (next/previous, focus, confirm, edit).
2. Low-confidence threshold visually highlighted; list view can filter/sort by confidence.
3. Hotkeys documented and discoverable in UI.
