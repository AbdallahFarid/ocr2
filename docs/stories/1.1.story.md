# 1.1 — Preflight Processing

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** deterministic preflight processing (deskew, denoise, dewarp, contrast, orientation fix, blur rejection),
**so that** downstream OCR and parsing operate on clean inputs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given a 300dpi scan, preflight produces a corrected image (deskewed, denoised, dewarped, contrast-adjusted, correctly oriented).
2. Blurry images below the Laplacian variance threshold are rejected with a machine-readable error.
3. Processing is deterministic given the same input.
4. Unit tests cover each transform; an integration test validates the full pipeline on golden samples.

- Preflight steps and thresholds [Source: architecture/components.md#1-capture-preflight]
- Tech stack baseline [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Coding conventions [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Testing requirements [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing
- Test file location: `backend/tests/ocr/test_preflight.py`
- Standards: follow `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; aim for ≥ 85% coverage on core modules
- Frameworks: `pytest`; include property-based tests where feasible
- Story-specific: cover deterministic transforms and blur threshold behavior per `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement OpenCV pipeline in `backend/app/ocr/preflight.py` [Source: architecture/components.md#1-capture-preflight]
- [x] Add configuration for thresholds (e.g., blur) in a single config module.
- [x] Write unit tests for each transform in `backend/tests/ocr/test_preflight.py` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- [ ] Create integration tests using golden images.
- [x] Ensure logs include correlation IDs and no PII [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Project Structure Notes
- Place image processing under `backend/app/ocr/` per unified project structure.
